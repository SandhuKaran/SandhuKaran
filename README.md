# Hi there! 👋 I'm Karan

Third year Computer Science student at McMaster University. 
I have a keen interest in web development and enjoy working on various projects that make life easier and more efficient.

## 🚀 Projects

### [BookHive](https://github.com/SandhuKaran/BookHive)
Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Postgres, the University Library Management System is a production-grade platform featuring a public-facing app and an admin interface. It offers advanced functionalities like seamless book borrowing with reminders and receipts, robust user management, automated workflows, and a modern, optimized tech stack for real-world scalability.

### [TravelEase](https://travel-ease-client.vercel.app/)
I developed an app that takes multiple addresses and calculates the fastest path to visit all of them, effectively solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using brute force. This app was developed to improve scheduling and efficiency in the lawn maintenance service I managed last year, reducing travel times and saving fuel costs.

### [GNW Website](https://sandhukaran.github.io/GNW/)
I designed the GNW Landscaping website with a focus on user experience and modern aesthetics. I also implemented a responsive design to ensure optimal viewing on all devices, and integrated various interactive elements to provide a seamless and intuitive user journey. The goal was to create a visually appealing and functional website that effectively communicates the services and values of GNW Landscaping.

## 🌱 I'm currently learning
- Advanced React and state management.
- Optimization techniques for solving complex problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem.
- Enhancing web animations and user interactions.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
- Creating an online chat app, focusing on sockets, authentication, privacy, security, and HTTP protocols.
- Developing a user database for GNW Landscaping to digitalize the user base and streamline company operations.
